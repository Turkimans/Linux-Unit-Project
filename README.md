# Linux-Unit-Project

Project name: Automate Git add, commit and push


### A Overview:
This bash script will first initialize a git repository in the current directory. Then, it will
ask the user for the file name. The user's response will be stored in the variable file_name. The
script will then check if the file exists. If the file does not exist, the script will print an error
message and exit. Finally, the script will add the file to the git repository, commit the changes
with the commit message that the user entered, set the main branch, add the remote repository
that the user entered, and push the changes to the remote repository.
